# Trend Chief EA

This is the code for the Trend Chief EA, a forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This EA is designed to analyze market trends and execute buy or sell orders based on specific signals.

## Parameters

- Timeframe: The timeframe for analysis (default: PERIOD_M15)
- BuySignal: The signal value for buy (default: 1)
- SellSignal: The signal value for sell (default: -1)

## How it Works

The Trend Chief EA works by using the Trend Chief indicator to determine the current market trend. It then checks for specific conditions to execute buy or sell orders.

The EA first checks if the current timeframe is set to the specified timeframe. If not, it returns without taking any action.

Next, it retrieves the value of the Trend Chief indicator using the iCustom function. The value represents the current trend in the market.

If the trend is bullish (BuySignal), the EA checks if the price crosses the main red trend line. If it does, it further checks if all other trend lines have turned green. If these conditions are met, a buy order is executed.

On the other hand, if the trend is bearish (SellSignal), the EA checks if the price crosses the main green trend line. If it does, it further checks if all other trend lines have turned red. If these conditions are met, a sell order is executed.
